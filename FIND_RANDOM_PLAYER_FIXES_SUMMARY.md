- Canvas event listener removal

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates memory leaks during long sessions
- Prevents multiple event handlers from stacking
- Improved performance over time

### 5. **Disconnect Handler Conflict Resolution** ‚úÖ
**Location**: `setupRealtimeRoom()` and `setupPongRoom()`
**Fix Applied**:
- Active disconnect handler tracking with Set data structure
- Proper cancellation of old handlers before setting new ones
- Enhanced error handling for disconnect operations

**Benefits**:
- Prevents disconnect handler conflicts
- Ensures reliable disconnection detection
- Proper cleanup on player leave

### 6. **Database Consistency & Realtime DB Migration** ‚úÖ

- Improved orphaned room detection and removal

**Benefits**:
- Consistent database architecture
- Better real-time performance
- Reduced database pollution

### 7. **Enhanced Error Handling & Recovery** ‚úÖ
**Location**: All major functions
**Fix Applied**:
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks with specific error handling
- Network error recovery mechanisms
- Graceful degradation on failures
- User-friendly error messages

**Benefits**:
- Better user experience during errors
- Automatic recovery from transient failures
- Proper state reset after errors

### 8. **Page Unload & Visibility Change Handling** ‚úÖ
**Location**: Window event listeners
**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced beforeunload cleanup with multiple approaches
- Visibility change detection for mobile browsers
- Improved disconnect data consistency

**Benefits**:
- Proper cleanup when users close tabs/browser
- Better mobile browser support
- Reduced orphaned sessions

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Test Suite Created
