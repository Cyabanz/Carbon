# Reaction Time Game - Bugs Found and Fixed

## Overview
This document lists all the bugs found in the reaction time multiplayer game system and their fixes.

## Critical Bugs Found

### 1. **Random Player Function Working Correctly** ‚úÖ

- **Location**: Multiple game initialization functions
- **Issues**:
  - Missing validation of required game state properties
  - No fallback for corrupted game states
  - Crashes when essential data is missing

### 10. **Winner Detection Logic** ‚ùå MEDIUM PRIORITY
- **Status**: BUG CONFIRMED
- **Location**: `processReactionRound()` function
- **Issues**:
  - Edge cases in tie-breaking not handled
  - Score calculation might have off-by-one errors
  - Winner announcement timing issues

## Additional Issues Found

### Performance Issues
- Excessive Firebase writes causing quota concerns
- No rate limiting on player actions
- Missing cleanup of event listeners

### UI/UX Issues
- Inconsistent loading states
- Missing error feedback to users
- Poor mobile responsiveness in reaction game

### Security/Cheating Prevention
- No server-side validation of reaction times
- Possible client-side manipulation of game state
- Missing anti-cheat mechanisms

## Fix Priority
1. **CRITICAL**: Guest name display, reaction game state management
2. **HIGH**: Click handler bugs, game starting sync, timeout race conditions
3. **MEDIUM**: Firebase error handling, winner detection, mobile controls
4. **LOW**: Performance optimizations, UI polish
