# AI.html and Settings.html Improvements

## 1. AI.html Enhancement

### What Was Added
Enhanced `ai.html` to match the beautiful background system from `games.html`.

### Changes Made
- **Added Floating Background Elements**: 3 animated floating orbs with different sizes and positions
- **CSS Animations**: Added `@keyframes float` for smooth 20-second floating animations with rotation
- **Theme Integration**: Used CSS custom properties that work with the existing `carbon-theme.js` system
- **Optimized Implementation**: Used pure CSS instead of Tailwind since ai.html doesn't include Tailwind

### Technical Details
- **Floating Elements**: Three gradient orbs using theme colors (`var(--theme-foam)`, `var(--theme-iris)`, `var(--theme-love)`, `var(--theme-rose)`)
- **Animation Delays**: Staggered delays (0s, 7s, 14s) for natural movement
- **CSS Classes**: Custom `.floating-bg` classes with proper positioning and styling
- **Performance**: Smooth 60fps animations with `ease-in-out` timing

### Code Structure
```css
.floating-bg {
  position: absolute;
  border-radius: 50%;
  opacity: 0.05;
  filter: blur(60px);
  pointer-events: none;
  animation: float 20s infinite ease-in-out;
}
```

### Result
AI.html now has the same beautiful floating background animations as games.html, fully integrated with the Carbon theme system.

## 2. Settings.html Background Refresh Fix

### The Issue
When refreshing `settings.html`, the selected background (Solid, Pattern, Particles) would not persist and would always default to Gradient instead.

### Root Cause
**localStorage Key Inconsistency**: The code was saving background preferences to `'carbon-background-global'` but loading them from `'carbon-background'`.

### What Was Broken
```javascript
// SAVING (Line 470, 835)
localStorage.setItem('carbon-background-global', currentBackground);

// LOADING (Line 416) - WRONG KEY!
const savedBg = localStorage.getItem('carbon-background') || 'gradient';
```

### The Fix
Updated the loading function to use the correct key:
```javascript
// FIXED (Line 417)
const savedBg = localStorage.getItem('carbon-background-global') || 'gradient';
```

### How It Works Now
1. **User selects background** in settings (Gradient/Solid/Pattern/Particles)
2. **Auto-save triggers** and saves to `'carbon-background-global'`
3. **Page refresh** loads from the correct `'carbon-background-global'` key
4. **Background is applied** via `applySettings()` → `applyBackground()`
5. **Persistence works** across refreshes and tabs

### Code Flow
```
DOMContentLoaded → loadSettings() → applySettings() → applyBackground()
```

### Result
✅ **Gradient** background persists on refresh  
✅ **Solid** background persists on refresh  
✅ **Pattern** background persists on refresh  
✅ **Particles** background persists on refresh  
✅ **Custom uploaded** backgrounds persist on refresh

## Summary

Both issues are now resolved:

1. **AI.html** has beautiful floating background animations matching the Carbon design system
2. **Settings.html** properly persists background choices across page refreshes

The fixes maintain full compatibility with the existing Carbon theme system and provide a consistent user experience across all pages.
