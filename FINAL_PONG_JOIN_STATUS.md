# 🎯 FINAL STATUS: Pong Room Join Bug Fix

## 🎉 **CRITICAL BUG SUCCESSFULLY FIXED** ✅

### **Issue**: Random player joins pong room but host doesn't see them join
### **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
### **Priority**: **HIGH** (Critical multiplayer functionality)

---

## 📋 **Summary**

**Problem**: When a player used "Find Random Player" to join a pong room, the host could not see that the guest had joined. The host's UI remained stuck showing "Waiting for Player..." while the guest could see both players and was ready to play.

**Root Cause**: Guest immediately set room status to `'playing'` when joining, preventing the host from seeing the join event during the `'waiting'` state.

**Solution**: Modified guest join process to keep status as `'waiting'` until host properly sees the guest and triggers game start.
